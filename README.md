# Complete JavaScript Course

This is the final JavaScript Course which I'll be taking in my career. I would not need to go through any courses/tutorials after that. I am going through this course to reinforce my learning of JavaScript and Front-End Development and will be tracking all my learning with this NOTES.md file by writing notes in the file.
